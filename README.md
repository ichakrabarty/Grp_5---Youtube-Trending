# Grp_5---Youtube-Trending Project Report

### Objective

The goal of the project is to apply the ETL concept using Pandas by extracting data from two different data sources (CSV and JSON), transform the data and import it into a relational (SQL) database.

### Datasets Used

Used Kaggle as the source of data for the project. The dataset provides the top trending videos on the YouTube platform.  It captures measurements of user interactions such as number of views, shares and likes.  Given complete data set is over one gigabyte in size, we opted to take the subset of data that covers only the US.  The name of the files and links to the source are listed below.
